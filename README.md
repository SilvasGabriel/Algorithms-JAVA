# Getting Started

>If you clone this repository remember to have installed all JAVA necessary to run it. This repo the files run it on JDK 22.

### If you don't have the Java language extensions installed for VS Code, you will be prompted to install the [Microsoft Extension Pack](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=vscjava.vscode-java-pack) for Java. Follow the instructions and reload VS Code after the installation.

### This exercises are from the website (https://judge.beecrowd.com/en/login), mostly of them use the terminal.

### After you clone the repository:

`cd src`

### Next you can run one of the exercises using the command:

`java <name of the file>.java`

#### If you have some problem on vscode look at the folder .vscode/settings.json add the path to your JDK in java.project.referencedLibraries
